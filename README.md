# Attendance Management System

## Introduction
Attendance Management System is an application developed using python that uses
machine learning to detect and recognize faces of the students and mark their attendance automatically. 
The system provides a convenient and efficient method of
marking and maintaining attendance. The system allows the teacher to click a few
group images of the students. The system will automatically detect faces from the
group images of students and recognize the detected faces. After recognition it
marks attendance thus saving time and money.

## Tools and Techniques Used
1. **Face Detection** - HaarCascade frontal face algorithm
2. **Feature Extraction** - FaceNet
3. **Face Recognition** - SVM Classifier
4. **GUI** - Tkinter 
5. **Database** - SQL Database
6. **Python Libraries** - OpenCV, Keras, Numpy, PIL, Sklearn, Tkinter.
